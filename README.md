# CodeForces-Solutions
My solutions to questions on CodeForces!

- I have used the "problem code" at the start of every filename if you want to find it for yourself. 
- The answers may not be the most optimal, but they work. I have tried to optimise few but not all.
- There are many comments in the files explaining my thought process and what each part of the program is doing. This should help in understanding my code.

I mainly used C since that is what I am learning right now in my university and solving the questions in C would be helpful in understanding how C works. 

## Hope this was helpful! <3
